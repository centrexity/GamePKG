# Port fidelity audit

Audit date: 2026-10-17. Compare behavior against each credited, pinned upstream
revision. A playable port or passing smoke test does not prove feature parity.
The implementation tracker is [port-parity.toml](port-parity.toml); unfinished
work stays open until behavior is verified.

## Confirmed missing or changed behavior

| Port | Remaining gaps |
| --- | --- |
| Cube 2 | Remaining uncommon/extended media keys and full controller/touch equivalence; LAN discovery, master authentication and public server registration; custom asset/mod workflows; demo/movie output and persistence; hardware-accelerated engine rendering; native platforms beyond Linux. Vulkan currently presents software-rendered engine frames. |
| DOOM | Original WAD music, spatial stereo effects, six save slots, configuration, desktop controls and the original quit/ENDOOM flow are runtime verified. Music backend selection, multiplayer, additional WADs/mods and broader control/platform coverage remain unfinished. |
| Zelda3 | External MSU music, replay tools, save states, widescreen, language selection and desktop enhancement settings need support. The adapter fixes the view to 256×224. Original DSP stereo is verified in native and Wasm gameplay/save tests. |
| Arkanoo | Editor, mouse controls, original menus/music and portal/gravity mechanics are omitted. Art, effects and endless generation are replacements. Current runs do not persist; high score and unlocked level do. |
| 2048 | Deterministic placement and exclusively 2-valued spawns replace randomized spawning. Scoring, win/game-over flow, restart, undo, board persistence and solver functionality are missing. The pinned upstream representation caps tiles at 32768. |

Evidence: [README coverage table](../README.md#port-feature-coverage),
[DOOM adapter](../engines/doom/adapters/engine.c),
[Zelda adapter](../engines/zelda3/adapters/engine.c),
[Arkanoo credits](../ports/arkanoo/CREDITS.md), and
[2048 implementation](../ports/2048/source/src/lib.rs).

Cube 2's physical keyboard path now preserves Pause, keypad distinctions and
left/right modifiers. Actual desktop tests verify their independent bindings,
the original console and saved preferences. Accepted text stays ordered with
keys, including paste and committed IME input; preedit text is not captured.
This does not establish full controller, touch or platform coverage.

## What GamePKG needs to add

- Complete ordered keyboard, pointer and controller events, including original
  bindings and rebinding, through host-controlled input.
- Scoped resource import and enumeration for mods, extra WADs, custom maps,
  language assets and optional music. Preserve original user files in place.
- Scoped persistence for all save slots, configuration, replays and recordings,
  with versioned save compatibility and explicit import/export.
- Channel-aware audio throughout each adapter, plus music backends and controls.
- Scoped networking for discovery, authentication and multiplayer workflows.
- Per-game enhancement settings where the original engine exposes them.
- Hardware graphics and native platform support where currently absent.

These require bounded host APIs or virtual resources. Keep filesystem, network
and process isolation while restoring functionality. A stub is only acceptable
when a verified host replacement provides the same observable behavior.

## Completion evidence required

For every restored feature, test its normal path, denied-permission behavior,
malformed input and persistence where applicable. Verify original bindings,
menus, audio channels/music, save/load across every slot, resource selection,
and multiplayer using actual engines. Compare replacements with the pinned
upstream behavior rather than merely checking that they run.

Run full level/campaign coverage separately from startup and short gameplay
tests. Test cross-version saves and each claimed native platform. Rebuild and
verify the packages and catalog users import after source changes. Record
unverified behavior explicitly; do not silently skip it or describe it as done.
